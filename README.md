# Lab Journal

#### Hosted using GitHub Pages [**here!**](https://jakuj.github.io/cg-lab-journal/)

This repository contains the source code for the lab journal for the *02561 Computer Graphics* course at the Technical University of Denmark.

## What?

The journal was developed over the course of the 2019/20 winter semester. It consists primarily of 10 short projects (referred to as worksheets) which serve as introduction to increasingly more complex problems in computer graphics - all implemented using WebGL.

The final project concerns a rendering technique known as sphere tracing. The final report is included [at the root of the repository](Final_Project_Report.pdf).
